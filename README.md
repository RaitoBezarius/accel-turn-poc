Accel Turn -- Proof of Concept
===============================


I like Freezing. *
Not I like it for the boobs or anything.

But man, Pandora are so cool when they're using Accel, Tempest or any high-end skill.
So I wanted to know if there were a way to implement it inside a MMORPG.

What could be the gameplay of such a skill ?

I want to explore this, through this proof of concept.

## Some random informations about this project

- It is built using Python on the server. (Faster than doing plain C++ with Boost.Asio)
- The client will be built using C++ and SFML. (But I can s/C++/Python/g if I feel like it.)
- There'll no authentication, nor advanced AI, pathfinding shitty, things. It's a PROOF OF CONCEPT about the usability of such skill in MMORPG.
- There'll be a lot of ACCEL TURN. DOUBLE ACCEL. TRIPLE ACCEL. TEMPEST TURN. UNLIMITED ACCEL WORKS. *

## Building this project
Hmmmm. As for Python, you need Twisted and enum34 lib. It's for Python 2.7 btw. Don't have time to work with Py3.
For client, I hope that it won't be shitty build system and that will allow me to work on Linux and Windows at the same time. :)

* Freezing isn't the only anime to featuring acceleration ability, Fate/Zero too, Kyoukaisenjou to Horizon, and a lot of animes loves to show that.
* Anime Inside. (TM)
