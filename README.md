Accel Turn -- Proof of Concept
===============================


I like Freezing. *
Not I like it for the boobs or anything.

But man, Pandora are so cool when they're using Accel, Tempest or any high-end skill.
So I wanted to know if there were a way to implement it inside a MMORPG.

What could be the gameplay of such a skill ?

I want to explore this, through this proof of concept.

## Some random informations about this project

- It is built using Python on the server and client. (Faster than doing plain C++ with Boost.Asio)
- I hope I'll implement some client prediction and lag compensation maybe.
- There'll no authentication, nor advanced AI, pathfinding shitty, things. It's a PROOF OF CONCEPT about the usability of such skill in MMORPG.
- There'll be a lot of ACCEL TURN. DOUBLE ACCEL. TRIPLE ACCEL. TEMPEST TURN. UNLIMITED ACCEL WORKS. *

## Running this project
You need Twisted, enum34 and PySFML :).
